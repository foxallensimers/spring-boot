git.commit.message.full=Isolate Aether in a separate class loader\n\nPrior to this commit, the Aether-based GrapeEngine was loaded in the\nsame class loader as the rest of Boot. This led to Aether's and its\ndependencies' types polluting the application's class path. Most\nnotably, this caused problems with logging as the logging framework\ncould be permaturely initialized.\n\nThis commit isolates AetherGrapeEngine, Aether and its dependencies\ninto a separate class loader. This is done by customizing the\npackaging of the CLI's jar file with the internal directory housing\nall of the types that will be loaded by the separate class loader.\n

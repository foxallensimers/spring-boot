The preceding example retrieves the summary for jobs in the `samples` group.
The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/quartz/job-group/http-response.adoc[]



[[quartz-job-group-response-structure]]

[[quartz-job]]
== Retrieving Details of a Job

To retrieve the details about a particular job, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/quartz/jobs/\{groupName}/\{jobName}`, as shown in the following curl-based example:

include::{snippets}/quartz/job-details/curl-request.adoc[]

The preceding example retrieves the details of the job identified by the `samples` group and `jobOne` name.
The resulting response is similar to the following:

include::{snippets}/quartz/job-details/http-response.adoc[]

If a key in the data map is identified as sensitive, its value is sanitized.

[[quartz-job-response-structure]]
=== Response Structure

The response contains the full details of a job including a summary of the triggers associated with it, if any.
The triggers are sorted by next fire time and priority.
The following table describes the structure of the response:

The preceding example retrieves the details of trigger identified by the `samples` group and `example` name.

The resulting response has a common structure and a specific additional object according to the trigger implementation.
There are five supported types:

* `cron` for `CronTrigger`
* `simple` for `SimpleTrigger`
* `dailyTimeInterval` for `DailyTimeIntervalTrigger`
* `calendarInterval` for `CalendarIntervalTrigger`
* `custom` for any other trigger implementations

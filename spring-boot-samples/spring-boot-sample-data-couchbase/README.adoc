= Spring Boot Couchbase Sample

This sample demonstrates how you can store a simple document using Spring Data Couchbase.

The sample expects couchbase to run on your machine with a bucket named `mybucket` and
`couchbase` for the password. You can customize these settings in `application.properties`.

Before you use the sample, you need _at least_ to create an `all` view for the `User`: go
to the Couchbase serverâ€™s admin console and visit the Views screen, then click `Create
Development View` and name it `all` with `user` as document name. On that view, you need
to change the code to:

```java
function (doc, meta) {
  if (doc._class == "sample.data.couchbase.User") {
    emit(meta.id, null);
  }
}
```

and the _reduce_ function to `_count`. After you've saved your changes go back to `Views`
and click on `Publish` so that the `all` view move to the `Production Views` tab.

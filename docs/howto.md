# How Do I Do That With Spring Boot?

Here is a starting point for a potentially large collection of micro
HOWTO guides. If you want to add a placeholder for a question without
an answer, put it at the top (at header level 2) and we can fill in
the gaps later.

## Configure Tomcat

## Configure Jetty

## Test a Spring Boot Application

A Spring Boot application is just a Spring `ApplicationContext` so
nothing very special has to be done to test it beyond what you would
normally do with a vanilla Spring context. One thing to watch out for
though is that the external properties, logging and other features of
Spring Boot are only installed in the context by default if you use
`SpringApplication` to create it. Spring Boot has a special Spring
`TestContextLoader` which makes this job easy. For example (from the
JPA Sample):

```java
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = SampleDataJpaApplication.class, 
        loader = SpringApplicationContextLoader.class)
public class CityRepositoryIntegrationTests {

	@Autowired
	CityRepository repository;

...
```

To use the `SpringApplicationContextLoader` you need the test jar on
your classpath (recommended Maven co-ordinates
"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test"). The context
loader guesses whether you want to test a web application or not
(e.g. with `MockMVC`) by looking for the `@WebAppConfiguration`
annotation (`MockMVC` and `@WebAppConfiguration` are from the Spring
Test support library).

## Externalize the Configuration of SpringApplication

A `SpringApplication` has bean properties (mainly setters) so you can
use its Java API as you create the application to modify its
behaviour. Or you can externalize the configuration using properties
in `spring.main.*`. E.g. in `application.properties` you might have

```properties
spring.main.web_environment: false
spring.main.show_banner: false
```

and then the Spring Boot banner will not be printed on startup, and
the application will not be a web application.

## Create a Non-Web Application

Not all Spring applications have to be web applications (or web
services). If you want to execute some code in a `main` method, but
also bootstrap a Spring application to set up the infrastructure to
use, then it's easy with the `SpringApplication` features of Spring
Boot. A `SpringApplication` changes its `ApplicationContext` class
depending on whether it thinks it needs a web application or not. The
first thing you can do to help it is to just leave the web
depdendencies off the classpath. If you can't do that (e.g. you are
running 2 applications from the same code base) then you can
explicitly call `SpringApplication.setWebEnvironment(false)`, or set
the `applicationContextClass` property (through the Java API or with
[external properties](#main.properties)). Application code that you
want to run as your business logic can be implemented as a
`CommandLineRunner` and dropped into the context as a `@Bean`
definition.

## Create a Deployable WAR File

Use the `SpringBootServletInitializer` base class, which is picked up
by Spring's Servlet 3.0 support on deployment. Add an extension of
that to your project and build a WAR file as normal. For more detail,
see the ["Converting a JAR Project to a WAR" guide][gs-war] on the
spring.io website.

The WAR file can also be executable if you use the Spring Boot build
tools. In that case the embedded container classes (to launch Tomcat
for instance) have to be added to the WAR in a `lib-provided`
directory. The tools will take care of that as long as the
dependencies are marked as "provided" in Maven or Gradle. Here's a
Maven example
[in the Boot Samples](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-traditional/pom.xml).

## Create a Deployable WAR File for older Servlet Containers

Older Servlet containers don't have support for the
`ServletContextInitializer` bootstrap process used in Servlet 3.0. You
can still use Spring and Spring Boot in these containers but you are
going to need to add a `web.xml` to your application and configure it
to load an `ApplicationContext` via a `DispatcherServlet`.

TODO: add some detail.

## Discover Built-in Options for External Properties

Spring Boot binds external properties from `application.properties`
(or `.yml`) (and other places) into an application at runtime.  There
is not (and technically cannot be) an exhaustive list of all supported
properties in a single location because contributions can come from
additional JAR files on your classpath.  There is a sample
[`application.yml`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/docs/application.yml)
with a non-exhaustive and possibly inaccurate list of properties
supported by Spring Boot vanilla with autoconfiguration. The
definitive list comes from searching the source code for
`@ConfigurationProperties` and `@Value` annotations, as well as the
occasional use of `RelaxedEnvironment`
(c.f. [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration.java?source=c#L65)).

## Set the Active Spring Profiles

The Spring `Environment` has an API for this, but normally you would
set a System profile (`spring.profiles.active`) or an OS environment
variable (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`). E.g. launch your application with
a `-D...` argument (remember to put it before the main class or jar
archive):

```
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=production demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

In Spring Boot you can also set the active profile in
`application.properties`, e.g.

```properties
spring.profiles.active: production
```

A value set this is replaced by the System property or environment
variable setting, but not by the `SpringApplicationBuilder.profiles()`
method. Thus the latter Java API can be used to augment the profiles
without changing the defaults.

## Change the Location of External Properties of an Application

Properties from different sources are added to the Spring
`Environment` in a defined order, and the precedence for resolution is
1) commandline, 2) filesystem (current working directory)
`application.properties`, 3) classpath `application.properties`. To
modify this you can provide System properties (or environment variables) 

* `config.name` (`CONFIG_NAME`), defaults to `application` as the root
  of the file name
* `config.location` (`CONFIG_LOCATION`) is a comma-separated list of
  files to load. A separate `Environment` property source is set up
  for each document found, so the priority order is most significant
  first. Defaults to
  `file:./application.properties,classpath:application.properties`. If
  YAML is used then those files are also added to the list by default.

See `ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer` for more detail.

## Use YAML for External Properties

YAML is a superset of JSON and as such is a very convenient syntax for
storing external properties in a hierarchical format. E.g.

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: cruncher
  datasource:
    driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
server:
  port: 9000
```

Create a file called `application.yml` and stick it in the root of
your classpath, and also add `snake-yaml` to your classpath (Maven
co-ordinates `org.yaml:snake-yaml`). A YAML file is parsed to a Java
`Map<String,Object>` (like a JSON object), and Spring Boot flattens
the maps so that it is 1-level deep and has period-separated keys, a
lot like people are used to with `Properties` files in Java.

The example YAML above corresponds to an `application.properties` file

```properties
spring.application.name: cruncher
spring.datasource.driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
server.port: 9000
```

## Change Configuration Depending on the Environment

A YAML file is actually a sequence of documents separated by `---`
lines, and each document is parsed separately to a flattened map.

If a YAML document contains a `spring.profiles` key, then the
profiles value (comma-separated list of profiles) is fed into the
Spring `Environment.acceptsProfiles()` and if any of those profiles is
active that document is included in the final merge (otherwise not).

Example:

```yaml
server:
  port: 9000

---

spring:
  profiles: development
server:
  port: 9001

---

spring:
  profiles: production
server:
  port: 0
```

In this example the default port is 9000, but if the Spring profile
"development" is active then the port is 9001, and if "production" is
active then it is 0.

The YAML documents are merged in the order they are encountered (so
later values override earlier ones).

To do the same thing with properties files you can use
`application-${profile}.properties` to specify profile-specific
values.
